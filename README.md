# DJANGO with React Frontend

## Description

This was created to learn how to integrate React.js into the Django framework.

I have started tracking the project after creating most of the boilerplate.

**NOTE:** After researching how to integrate React, I found that I can simply
use create-react-app as normal. I may eventually create a branch with this
config instead.

### Stack

- Python with Django (Backend)
- Django Rest Framework for creating API
- React.js for the Frontend (Using Webpack and Babel as config)

### Getting Started

Remember you will need to run terminals for both the frontend and backend of the
app.

**Frontend: (from: music_controller/frontend/**

```
npm run dev
```

**Backend: (from: music_controller/)**

```
python manage.py runserver
```
