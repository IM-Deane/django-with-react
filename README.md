# DJANGO with React Frontend

## Description

This was created to learn how to integrate React.js into the Django framework.

I have started tracking the project after creating most of the boilerplate.

### Stack

- Python with Django (Backend)
- Django Rest Framework for creating API
- React.js for the Frontend (Using Webpack and Babel as config)
